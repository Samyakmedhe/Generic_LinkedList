# 🌐 Generic Linked List

A collection of **Linked List implementations** in multiple languages: **C, C++, Java, and Python**.  
This repository is designed for learning, practicing, and comparing data structure implementations across different programming paradigms.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Generic (type-independent) linked list implementation  
- ✅ Implemented in **4 languages**: C, C++, Java, Python  
- ✅ Covers both **procedural** and **object-oriented** styles  
- ✅ Complete set of linked list operations:
  - Insert at head, tail, or specific position  
  - Delete by value or position  
  - Search for an element  
  - Count nodes  
  - Find min, max, and frequency  
  - Reverse the list  
  - Display all nodes  
- ✅ Menu-driven programs in **C, C++, Java**  
- ✅ Lightweight and Pythonic implementation

## 💻 Languages Covered

- **C** → Procedural, pointer-based, menu-driven  
- **C++** → OOP with `Node` and `LinkedList` classes  
- **Java** → OOP with interfaces, encapsulation, and menu-driven execution  
- **Python** → Minimal and dynamic with built-in object features
