## ✨ Features

- Generic (type-independent) linked list implementation  
- Supported operations:
  - Insert at head, tail, or position  
  - Delete by value / position  
  - Search for an element  
  - Count nodes  
  - Find min/max/frequency  
  - Reverse the list  
  - Traverse/Display list

## 💻 Languages Covered

- **C** → Procedural, menu-driven, pointer-based implementation  
- **C++** → Object-Oriented with classes, encapsulated `Node` and `LinkedList`  
- **Java** → Full OOP with `Node` class, `LinkedList` interface, and menu-driven `main`  
- **Python** → Clean dynamic implementation with minimal boilerplate
